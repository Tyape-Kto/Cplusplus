1). a+b+c acts as (a+b)+c
     as it operates from left to right

2). to declare variable,
    -int num1{0};
      where, 
       int = datatype
       num1 = instance of class int
       {0} = which sets default value of num1
3).
    [
     #include<iostream>
     #include<string>
     #include<iomanip>
     using std::setprecision;
     using namespace std;
     using std::fixed;
     int main(){
              int num1, num2;
              cin >> num1 >> num2; // 2 numbers with space in between are saved in this num1 and num2 instances 
          }
     
    ]

4). endl flushes all the output at once and it is not so important in small application but at large application cout may wait for other information 
          and it may not print at the exact step you want. so it has 2 functionality
          
5). when you have large double or long or float then it may show in e format which may cause problem at solving problem so i used setprecision(3) remember,
     -printf("%0.9lf",d);


6).  Note: when on linux - g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
                         - ./main.exe
     this way you can work on terminal
